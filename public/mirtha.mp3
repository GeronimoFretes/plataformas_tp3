Since there is no existing code and the update specifies replacing the file with a new one from a URL, the resulting "code" is simply a placeholder indicating the file should be replaced with the content from the provided URL.  There's no actual code to write. The file `public/mirtha.mp3` should be replaced with the file located at `https://hebbkx1anhila5yf.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/mirta-KIxt9s93JFRvxdE7BcxbTqjzzcfAES.mp3`.
